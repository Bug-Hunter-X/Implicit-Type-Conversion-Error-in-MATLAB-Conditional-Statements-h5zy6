# MATLAB Implicit Type Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion and its impact on conditional statements and array indexing.  The bug occurs when a function expects a numeric input but receives a character array instead.  MATLAB's implicit type conversion can lead to unexpected results in comparisons and arithmetic operations.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that exhibits the bug. The function intends to perform different operations based on the input value. However, if a character array is provided as input, MATLAB's implicit type conversion can lead to incorrect comparisons and calculations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3. Call the function with a numeric input (e.g., `myFunction(12)`).
4. Call the function with a character array input (e.g., `myFunction('15')`).
5. Observe the difference in output.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function that explicitly handles type conversion and avoids the bug.  The solution uses `str2double` to ensure the input is converted to a numeric type before any operations are performed. This prevents unexpected behavior caused by MATLAB's implicit type conversion.

## Conclusion

This example highlights the importance of explicit type handling in MATLAB, particularly when working with user inputs or data of uncertain types. Always ensure inputs are of the expected data type to avoid unexpected results and ensure the robustness of your code.
